# Objective
Iteratively improve the documentation quality, clarity, accuracy, technical correctness, security awareness, and visual appeal of the following files:

- `draper_exploit_evo/README.md`
- `draper_exploit_evo/task.md`
- `draper_formal_planner/README.md`
- `draper_formal_planner/task.md`

using multi-role collaboration, especially Librarian, Designer, Coder roles, and Hacker, with support from other roles as needed.

---

# Core Approach

- **Librarian:** Ensure clarity, comprehension, factual correctness, and no contradictions.
- **Designer:** Enhance visual quality, formatting, diagrams (consult `docs/mermaid_reference.md` for mermaid charts).
- **Coder Roles (Intern, Junior, Senior):** Review technical feasibility, implementation accuracy, and code-related content.
- **Hacker:** Review security-related aspects, identify potential concerns, and suggest clarifications.
- **Ask-Perplexity:** All roles should use the ask-perplexity tool if additional information or clarification is needed.
- **Iterate:** Repeat multi-role passes until documentation meets high standards.

# Recovery Plan (If Session Crashes)

1. Review this task plan document for the last completed `[X]` task.
2. Resume at the next `[ ]` task.
3. Relaunch environment if needed.
4. Continue iterative improvements.

# Notes

- Roles should document any lessons learned in `src/mcp_litellm/docs/lessons_learned.json`.
- Use version control (`git add`, `commit`, `tag`) after each phase completion.
- Escalate unresolved issues to Planner or human supervisor as needed.
