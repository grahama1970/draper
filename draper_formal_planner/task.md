# 🎯 Objective: AI-Driven Formal Verification Planner for DO-254

> **Note:** On-premises deployment significantly aids ITAR compliance by keeping data internal. Full compliance requires additional organizational controls (access restrictions, audits, training, documentation).

---

Develop an MCP-compatible, on-premises agentic R&D system (**draper-mcp-formal-planner**) to accelerate and enhance DO-254 formal verification of Draper's radiation-hardened hardware. The system leverages curated historical data, integrates SEU models, automates artifact generation, assists in AI-driven CEGAR loops, and incorporates human oversight for critical decisions.

---

## 🏗️ Core Components

- **🤖 Agentic Workflow (MCP):**  
  Orchestrated by `Boomerang`, coordinating:  
  `Planner`, `DraperRetriever`, `SeniorCoder-Formal`, `FormalVerifier`, `RadHardSpecialist`.  
  Includes mandatory human-in-the-loop steps for property validation and complex counterexample analysis.

- **🔍 Curated Data Retriever:**  
  `DraperRetriever` agent queries a vector database of curated historical verification assets. Requires initial data curation.

- **🛠️ EDA Tool Abstraction Layer:**  
  Python library wrapping formal tool interactions (initially VC Formal) and license management.

- **📄 Artifact Generation:**  
  `SeniorCoder-Formal` generates vPlans, SEU-aware SVAs, and covergroups aligned with DO-254 objectives.

- **🔄 AI-Assisted CEGAR:**  
  `FormalVerifier` runs proofs and annotates counterexamples.  
  `SeniorCoder-Formal` analyzes annotated CEX, suggests refinements, escalates complex cases for human review.

- **☢️ Radiation Awareness:**  
  `RadHardSpecialist` integrates Draper SEU models into property generation and analysis.

- **⚡ Resource Management:**  
  `Boomerang` manages license checks and job queuing.

- **📦 Packaging & Deployment:**  
  Secure on-premises deployment via Docker and `uv`, requiring GPU resources (H100 recommended).

## 🔄 Recovery Plan (If Session Crashes)

1. 🔍 Review `taskplan.md` for last completed task `[X]`.
2. ▶️ Resume at the first incomplete task `[ ]`.
3. 🚀 Relaunch environment and dependencies (`docker compose up -d`), restart MCP agents.
4. 📝 Instruct `Planner` to continue.

## 🔒 Security Implementation Checklist

### Access Control
- Enforce strict RBAC and ABAC policies for all agents, developers, and reviewers.
- Remove or disable all default accounts in formal tools, databases, and internal services.
- Prohibit shared credentials; assign unique, auditable identities to each user and agent.
- Segment design data, verification results, and credentials into isolated database schemas.
- Continuously audit access logs and monitor for anomalous activities.

### Key Management
- Store signing keys in HSMs or secure vaults.
- Automate key rotation schedules.
- Restrict key access to authorized signing agents and admins only.
- Separate key management duties from verification roles.
- Log all key lifecycle events.

### Audit Trails
- Centralize encrypted, immutable logs of agent actions, verification runs, signing, and reviews.
- Include timestamps, user/agent IDs, and event types.
- Enable alerts on suspicious activities.
- Require MFA or certificates for log access.
- Review logs regularly.

- Use behavioral analytics to detect anomalous user/agent behavior.
- Enforce least privilege across all roles.
- Conduct insider threat training.
- Perform periodic risk assessments.
- Establish an insider threat response team.

### Recovery Plan Security
- Protect backups and recovery images with cryptographic checksums.
- Require MFA for recovery operations.
- Isolate recovery infrastructure from operational networks.
