This project leverages intelligent autonomous agents to enhance the security, adaptability, and efficiency of complex software systems. These agents collaborate to identify vulnerabilities, plan secure operations, and dynamically respond to evolving threats. By integrating advanced reasoning and formal verification, the framework aims to provide robust, scalable solutions accessible to both technical experts and semi-technical stakeholders, ensuring clarity, transparency, and trust in automated decision-making.

# 🛡️ Autonomous Hardware Exploit Evolution System (v2.1 - Final)

> **Note:** On-premises deployment significantly aids ITAR compliance by keeping data internal. Full compliance requires additional organizational controls (access restrictions, audits, training, documentation).

## 🔒 Security Implementation Guidelines

### Access Control
- Enforce strict RBAC and ABAC policies for all agents, data stores, and UI components.
- Segment exploit data, cryptographic keys, and user credentials into isolated database schemas.
- Remove or disable all default accounts in ArangoDB, Docker, and internal services.
- Prohibit shared credentials; issue unique, auditable identities for each user and agent.
- Continuously audit access logs for anomalous or unauthorized activities.

### Key Management
- Store BLS signing keys and other sensitive secrets in hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure vaults.
- Automate key rotation policies with minimal manual intervention.
- Enforce least privilege on key access; only CryptoProver and authorized admins can access signing keys.
- Separate key management duties from exploit development and review roles.
- Track full key lifecycle events (creation, rotation, revocation, destruction).

### Audit Trails
- Centralize all logs (agent actions, exploit mutations, signing events, human reviews) in an immutable, encrypted log store.
- Include precise timestamps, user/agent IDs, and event types.
- Enable real-time alerts on suspicious activities or policy violations.
- Require strong authentication (MFA, certificates) for log access.
- Regularly review audit trails for compliance and incident response.

### Insider Threats
- Apply behavioral analytics to detect anomalous usage patterns by users and agents.
- Enforce least privilege across all roles, minimizing access to sensitive exploit data.
- Conduct regular insider threat training and awareness programs.
- Perform periodic risk assessments targeting privileged users and critical workflows.
- Establish a dedicated insider threat response team with clear escalation paths.

### Recovery Plan Security
- Protect recovery images, backups, and task state files with cryptographic checksums.
- Require MFA for initiating any recovery or restore operations.
- Isolate recovery infrastructure from operational networks to prevent lateral movement.
- Regularly test recovery procedures under adversarial conditions.
- Log all recovery actions with full auditability.

### Social Engineering Defense
- Maintain detailed incident response playbooks for phishing, pretexting, and impersonation attempts.
- Conduct regular phishing simulations targeting all user roles.
- Implement advanced email filtering, URL inspection, and attachment sandboxing.
- Use social engineering testing tools to identify and remediate weaknesses.
- Integrate social engineering defense into ongoing security awareness training.
