# Master README: AI-Driven Agentic Systems for Enhanced Hardware Verification at Draper

## Executive Summary

This document outlines two synergistic **Research & Development (R&D) proposals** aimed at leveraging advanced AI-driven agentic systems (built on the MCP framework) to significantly enhance Draper's secure hardware verification and validation (V&V) capabilities, particularly for radiation-hardened microelectronics. Both proposals focus on developing **on-premises, ITAR-compliant solutions** that function as intelligent assistants to Draper engineers, automating complex tasks, adapting to new challenges, and ultimately improving security, efficiency, and certification readiness. These initiatives directly support Draper's strategic goals in cyber-based V&V and digital engineering.

## Shared Concepts & Approach

Both proposed systems are built upon common principles:

*   **Agentic Workflows (MCP):** Utilizing specialized AI agents coordinated by an orchestrator to handle distinct tasks (e.g., HDL analysis, formal proofs, exploit mutation, data retrieval), enabling modularity and complex process management.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and techniques like Genetic Algorithms, LoRA fine-tuning, and advanced search to provide adaptive learning, intelligent automation, and insightful analysis.
*   **On-Premises & ITAR-Compliant:** Designed for deployment within Draper's secure infrastructure to protect sensitive IP and ensure compliance.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Incorporating human engineers for critical decision-making, validation, and oversight, ensuring the AI systems act as powerful assistants, not black boxes.
*   **R&D / Phased Development:** Proposed as initial R&D efforts to prove feasibility, with a phased approach to development and hardware investment (starting recommendation: 2x H100 GPUs).
*   **Data-Driven:** Success relies on leveraging and curating Draper's existing knowledge base (design data, historical V&V results, SEU models).

## Proposal 1: Autonomous Hardware Exploit Evolution System

*   **Goal:** Proactively and continuously discover potential vulnerabilities (including novel and radiation-induced exploits) in Draper's rad-hard designs *before* deployment.
*   **Approach:** An agentic system uses advanced **Genetic Algorithms** to *evolve* potential exploit vectors (test stimuli, timing manipulations). A **tiered fitness evaluation** (using simulation and formal methods integrated with Draper's SEU models) efficiently assesses exploit viability. The system **autonomously fine-tunes** its mutation strategies using LoRA models trained on historical and generated data. Findings are stored in a **knowledge graph**, and critical exploits require **human review** before patching is considered. **Cryptographic signatures** ensure exploit lineage traceability.
*   **Value Proposition:**
    *   Shifts from reactive patching to proactive vulnerability discovery.
    *   Potential to find non-obvious, complex, and radiation-related bugs.
    *   Builds an adaptive, evolving security testing capability specific to Draper designs.
    *   Provides verifiable evidence and structured analysis for security assessments.
*   **Status:** R&D Proposal. See detailed README, `.roomodes`, and `taskplan.md` for specifics.

## Proposal 2: AI-Driven Formal Verification Planner for DO-254

*   **Goal:** Accelerate and improve the rigor of the DO-254 formal verification process, reducing manual effort and enhancing certification artifact generation.
*   **Approach:** An agentic system assists verification engineers by:
    *   **Leveraging historical data:** A `DraperRetriever` agent queries a *curated* vector database of past verification assets (properties, reports) to suggest relevant reuse.
    *   **Automating artifact generation:** AI agents generate draft vPlans, SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA - incorporating SEU guidance), and covergroups.
    *   **Assisting debug:** Uses **AI-assisted Counterexample-Guided Refinement (CEGAR)**, where agents analyze formal tool counterexamples (CEX) and *suggest* property fixes or bug locations to the engineer.
    *   **Integrating SEU awareness:** Incorporates radiation effect considerations into generated properties and analysis.
    *   Requires **human validation** for retrieved properties and complex CEX analysis.
*   **Value Proposition:**
    *   Reduces time spent on writing properties and setting up verification environments.
    *   Accelerates coverage closure and debugging via AI-assisted CEX analysis.
    *   Improves consistency and quality of verification artifacts for DO-254.
    *   Captures and reuses valuable institutional knowledge from past projects.
*   **Status:** R&D Proposal. See detailed README, `.roomodes`, and `taskplan.md` for specifics.

## Synergy & Next Steps

These two R&D initiatives are complementary. Findings from the Exploit Evolver could potentially inform the focus areas or property generation for the Formal Planner in future integrations.

Both proposals represent significant R&D efforts requiring collaboration. Key next steps involve:

1.  **Discussing Alignment:** Confirming alignment with Draper's strategic priorities and technical roadmap.
2.  **Clarifying Assumptions:** Addressing the key questions outlined in each proposal regarding data accessibility (historical V&V, SEU models), specific toolchains, internal processes, and success metrics for the R&D phases.
3.  **Phased Approach:** Agreeing on the scope and milestones for an initial R&D phase, likely starting with the recommended 2x H100 GPU infrastructure.

We believe these agentic systems offer a powerful path towards next-generation hardware V&V capabilities, enhancing security and efficiency for Draper's critical missions. We recommend reviewing the detailed proposals for further technical information.
